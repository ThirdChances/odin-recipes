    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely grate the potato into a bowl, keeping the juice. 
            Add flour, egg, and salt, and stir with a wooden spoon. <br>
            Add water and stir until all the lumps are smoothed out. If the dough is too runny, add flour; if too thick, add water.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add salt. <br>
            Transfer the potato dough into the boiling water by using a spaetzle maker, or push the dough through a large grater or colander. <br>
            Gently boil all halušky for 7 or 8 minutes, until they all float to the top.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cut the bacon into cubes and fry untill crisp</li>    
        <li>Strain the halušky and mix with bryndza. Sprinkle the bacon on top and pour the rendered bacon fat all over. Salt to taste and serve immediately.</li>
