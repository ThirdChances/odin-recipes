    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Although mussels with fries are popular in many countries, it is thought that the dish originated in Belgium.<br>
        It is likely that it was originally created by combining mussels, a popular and cheap foodstuff eaten around the
        Flemish coast, and fried potatoes which were commonly eaten around the country in winter when no fish or other
        food was available.</p>


    <p>On average, between 25 and 30 tonnes of mussels are consumed each year in Belgium as moules-frites.
        Much of the mussels consumed in Belgium come from mussel farms in nearby Zeeland in the Netherlands.
    </p>
    <p>You can make this dish in a variety of ways with wine, beer, cream or just natural with water added.
        It is also usually served with "mosselsaus" which is a mix of mayonaise, mustard and cooking liquid from the
        mussels </p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg mussels per person</li>
        <li>2 sticks of celery</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>half a bundle of parsley</li>
        <li>400 ml white wine</li>
        <li>oil or butter</li>
        <li>salt, pepper and herbs to taste</li>
        <li>500 gr potatoes</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the mussels with clean water and remove the bad ones.<br>
            Cut up the onions and stew them in butter or oil until soft. Add the carrots and celery and let it stew for
            a couple of minutes.<br>
            Finely chop up the parsley and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Add the mussels and the white wine and let it stew with a lid until the mussels open up.<br>
            You can shake the pot with a lid a couple of times to mix all the flavours.<br>
            When the mussels are ready you can add the parsley</li>
        <li>Cut up the potatoes in fries and rinse them thoroughly with water. Dry your fries in a towel and deep fry
            them the first time at a temp of 140°C.<br>
            Let them cool down for a couple of minutes. <br></li>
        <li>Deep fry the fries again but this time at 180°C until crispy and golden brown.</li>
